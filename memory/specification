Creating a "Hello, World!" console application in C# is quite simple. You can get started by using any text editor, but Microsoft's Visual Studio is commonly used for C#. 

Here are the steps to create a console app in C#:

1. Launch Visual Studio.
2. On the start window, choose "Create a new project".
3. On the "Create a new project" window, enter or type console in the search box. 
4. Next, choose "Console App (.NET Core)" from the template list, then select Next.
5. After that, on the "Configure your new project" window, type or enter "HelloWorld" in the "Project name" box. Then, choose OK.
6. A new project is created with a class named Program that has a single method named Main. This method is the entry point of the app. Replace the code in the window with the following code and press Ctrl+S to save.

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}
```
7. To run your application, simply press Ctrl+F5. A console window should appear that displays the text: Hello, World!

Each significant part of the program:
- `using System`: This line includes the System namespace, which contains the Console class.
- `namespace HelloWorld`: The 'HelloWorld' namespace contains the definition of the `Program` class.
- `class Program`: This line declares the Program class.
- `Main` method: The Main method is the entry point of your application. When you run this application, it's this Main method that runs.
- `Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!")`: This line of code writes the text "Hello, World!" to the console output.
